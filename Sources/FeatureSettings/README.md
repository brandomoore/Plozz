# FeatureSettings

The Settings screen and its detail pages. Profile-aware, integration-aware,
and the single place caption customization lives.

## Responsibility

- `SettingsView` — the root focused list (themes, profiles, servers &
  libraries, integrations, captions, about). `SettingsRowStyle` &
  `SettingsContext` provide the shared look + the environment needed by
  every detail page.
- `ProfileDetailView` — manage the active profile: rename, recolor,
  switch / sign out of accounts, configure the Plex Home-user mapping
  (`PlexLinkedUserDetailView`).
- `ServerDetailView` + `ServersAndLibrariesDetailView` — manage stored
  servers / accounts (`AccountStore`), pick which Jellyfin libraries the
  current profile includes, remove accounts.
- `IntegrationsDetailView` — "Trackers" page: connect/disconnect for Trakt,
  Simkl, AniList & MyAnimeList (delegates to each tracker service) plus the
  Watch Status across-servers sync toggle.
- `PreferenceDetailViews` — subtitle behaviour / spoiler / diagnostics /
  Home-customization preferences. Subtitle *behaviour* (mode, language,
  auto-download) lives here; the subtitle *look* is now adjusted in the
  player while watching.
- `SettingsAboutSection` — app identity / version / release notes.
- `SettingsCommunityLinks` — separate Discord-first and GitHub cards shared by
  both About screens. Apple TV shows them below the app identity; iPhone and
  iPad offer logo-labeled direct links plus expandable QR cards. The cards use
  official icon-and-wordmark lockups directly on their surfaces, without colored
  icon tiles or duplicate name labels. They follow the theme's primary text color
  and stay outside the codes' white scan margins. Narrow layouts stack without
  shrinking the codes. Public destinations are centralized in `CoreModels.AppLinks`.
  Lockup sources are from [Discord](https://discord.com/branding) and
  [GitHub](https://brand.github.com/foundations/logo); original SVGs are in
  `docs/assets/{discord,github}-lockup.svg`. Their vector PDF exports use CairoSVG
  with `dpi=72` so source units map to PDF points without fractional-height
  rounding by the asset compiler:
  `python3 -c "import cairosvg; cairosvg.svg2pdf(url='docs/assets/discord-lockup.svg', dpi=72, write_to='App/Resources/Assets.xcassets/DiscordLockup.imageset/discord_lockup.pdf')"`
  (substitute `github` / `GitHubLockup` for the GitHub export).
  The Discord mark comes from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) (CC0).
  Its original path is in `docs/assets/discord-mark.svg`; the asset catalog uses
  a vector PDF because Xcode's SVG renderer distorts this path's compact arcs.
  Regenerate it with
  `python3 -c "import cairosvg; cairosvg.svg2pdf(url='docs/assets/discord-mark.svg', write_to='App/Resources/Assets.xcassets/DiscordMark.imageset/discord_mark.pdf')"`.

## Invariants

- **Profile-namespaced settings.** Per-user prefs (theme, captions,
  diagnostics, spoiler) are namespaced by the active profile id; the
  default profile uses no suffix so an upgrading install keeps existing
  values (`migrateLegacyIfNeeded` in `ProfileStore`).
- **No tokens here.** Account & Trakt token management is delegated to
  `FeatureAuth.AccountStore` / `TraktService.TraktTokenStore`.
- **Dual-provider.** Server/library management must work for both Plex
  and Jellyfin accounts (Plex Home-user mapping is Plex-specific, but
  the UI must clearly say so).
- **No persistence schema duplication.** Persistence lives in
  `CoreModels` / `FeatureAuth` / `TraktService`; this module only
  **edits** what they store.

## Where to look first

- `SettingsView.swift` — the row composition (the tree of detail pages).
- `ProfileDetailView.swift` — profile-scoped editing.
- `PreferenceDetailViews.swift` — caption / spoiler / diagnostics prefs.
